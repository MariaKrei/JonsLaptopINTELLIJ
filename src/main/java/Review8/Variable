Local - inside block of code. whenever i a, writing any logic or need to store some data i have to chose local
if(10>5){
int sum=0;}
Cant be used outside of block of code

Instance - we use when we want to create multiple objects, whenewer i want to reuse
 variable at least at two methods i have to choose instance.

 Static -global variables -
 local - in method
 instance - in class
 static - anywhere, if we put public static

 How do we know when we should create a static variable
 whenever we want to store somwthing that is universal (constance) and it does ussually change we safely go and
 create static variable for that.
 if we donmt use any instance  variables we can do static.
 How do we know when we create static method?
 when our methods dont requaire instance fields we create static
