Method is a block of code that performs a specific action when called.
In Java methods can only exist inside a class. If method is instance method we need to create the object of the class to call if method is static we use name of the class method name.
Benefit : they allow us to reuse code
Tyes of methods:
1) methods with void - when you dont plan to use something in other classes
2) Methods with specific return types (String, int double)
