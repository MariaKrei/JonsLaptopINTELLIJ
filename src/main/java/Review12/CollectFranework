Coll Framework is collection of classes and interfaces which help us store data easily. The clesses in this framework dynamic and have a lot of built in methods
that we can use to manipulate data .
Mian Interfaces:
List:
1) can store duplicate numbers
2)remember the order
There are 2 main classes which implement  the llist interface:
a)ArrayLIst
2) LInkedList
Difference:
ArrayList internally uses array which makes accessing the elements fast but adding or removing the elements is superslow.
On the othr hand linkedList uses a doublely LinkedList internally.

if w eneed add or removed we use linked
if extract we use arraylist


SEt:
doesn't allow duplicates .
!)Hashset: fast , and minus - print in random order, doent remember order
2)LinkedHashSet: remember the order but slower than HashSet
3)TreeSet: sorted, but imsertion is very slow


Maps
!) HashMap 2)LinkedHashMap 3)TreeMap
