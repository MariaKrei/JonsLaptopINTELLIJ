Inheritance allows us to build classes from existing classes.
We can inherit fields and methods from existing classes if we need them in other classes.
There are 5 major types of inheritance.
1) Single inheritance (1 parent one child)
2) Hierarchical Inheritance (1 parent and several child)
3)multilevel inheritance (grandparent - parent - child - grand child
