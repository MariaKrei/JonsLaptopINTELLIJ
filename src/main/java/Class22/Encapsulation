Encapsulation:
1) for every entities should be separate class
2) instance variables should be private

Encaps says create a class for every entity and define methods related to that
 entity in that class instead of putting everything inside the main method.
 It says make your fields private and define getter setter method for this fields.
benefits: secured and orginized code.
