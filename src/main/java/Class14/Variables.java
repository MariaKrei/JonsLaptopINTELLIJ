    /*
    There are 3 types of variables in Java with respect to scope/visibility/accessibility
    1)local
    2)instance
    3) static

    1)Local variables: variables which are defind inside the block of code like if-else statement, loops,
     switch statement
   ,methods. They can only be accesesed with-in that block of code.
   + they occupy the memory for least amount of time inside your computer. We should always try to go with local variables.
   - they can be only be accessed with-in the same block where they are created




   Instance variables: -the variables which are defined inside the class but outside of block of codelike method, if-else statement.
   They can be accessed anywhere in the class expect static methods.
+ can be accessed anywhere inside the class other than static method
- they occupied memory for longer than local variable


Static Variables:
Static variables are creatied using static keyword . they are also created outside of blocks of code like methods, loops etc
+ we can save lots of space
- occupies memory for longest
used without an object and can hold only one copy of object
