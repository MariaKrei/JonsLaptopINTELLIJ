   Type casting is changing the datatype of data.
   Data type from small to large:
   byte
    short
    int
    long
    float
    double

    There are two types of casting when we move from small to large it is called: automatic/widening/implicit
    When we move from large to small it is called Manual/Narrowing/Explicit
    we have to put () with name
    Why do we need type casting?
    Why we need type casting?
    1) Sometimes we might be intrested in whole numbers and want to ignore decimal parts
    2) Wnen multiply developers work on the same project they migth use different data types, and we migth have to convert these before we merge the code
    What is the syntax
    No syntax when we move from smaller to larger box simply assign the values and conversion will happens.
    When we move from larger to smaller box we have to use ()inside them we specify destination data type
    double box1=12.3;
    int box2=(int)box1;

    Relational Operators:
    Relational Operators help us compare things.They return the answer in the form of boolean true or false.
    > greater than
    < less than
    == equal to
    != not equal to
    >= greater than or equal to
    <= less than or equal to
    Example
    10>5   true
    5>7 false
    5<10 true
    5<2 false
    13==11 false
    10!=10 false
    10!=12 true
    1=>2 false
    2+>2 true
    10<=10 true or false -> true
    5<=8 true
