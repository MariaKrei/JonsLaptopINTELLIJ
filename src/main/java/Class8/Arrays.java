    //We use indexing to store and access the data in an array.Every element that we store in an array is assigned a number. These numbers start from 0
    //Why we should use arrays:
  //  Its not feasible to use variables for large amount of data.
    //storing managing searching large amounts of data becomes easier with arrays and loops
    //Syntax of Arrays
    //We can create arrays in two ways
    //1) DataType[] nameOfArray={item1, item2, item3}
    //String[] names={"Kawoon, "Patric"};

    //2.   DataType[] nameOfArray=new DataType[size];
   // int[] numbers=
