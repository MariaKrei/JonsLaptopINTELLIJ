Abstractions is something what is not clear or not complete.
We use abstraction to create methods which are not incomplete. They dont have a body.
 They have only method headers(signature + non access modifier).

 Why should we use abstract method:
 1) when we know that every child will be overriding a method we don't need to have a method body
 2) It acts as a template when we create a method as abstract every child must provide body for that.
 it is used to enforce methods

 rules:
 1) as soon as we have any abstract method we have to add abstract word to class
 2) no restriction, we can have normal methods and abstract methods
 3) whenever we create abstract class we cannot create an object of this class
 4) cannot be private or cannot use final keyword

 Intetrfaces:
 is something which is common two sysytem. It is like a contract that help us know what type of methods should be present in a class for that class to be able to work with other classes.
