    Methods in Java:
    Methods/Functions/Behaviours are blocks of code.
    They contain statement (lines of code) which are executed when method is called.
    A method in java has a return type (output) name and parameters/arguments (inputs).

    Why shoukd we use it?
    Methods help us to reuse the code.When we need to share or reuse a piece of code within our project
     or with others we can create our own classes define methods inside those classes
      and we can start reusing/sharing them


      Syntax:
      returnType(output)  (what form will return)   nameOfTheMethod   (input/ arguments/parameters) {}
