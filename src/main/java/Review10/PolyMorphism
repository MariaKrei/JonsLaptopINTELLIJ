Poly
it is mechanism in java that allows us //always stat with this words
t is mechanism in java that allows the methods to behave differently depending upon which object are using to call them. There are two types of polymorphism dynamic and static.
Dynamic poly is achieved through method through overriding method.
Static polymorphism is achieved through method overloading.
Why should we use poly:
1) It allows us to avoid code repetition. If we have to call multiple methods from multiple classes and they are all sibling classes

What do we need to apply Poly
1) Inheritance
2)method overriding
3) Type casting
4)Loops
5)arrays
